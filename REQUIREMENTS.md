# Music Organizer Tool -- Requirements

Music Organizer will be a program that performs the following functions:

when invoked with a given directory (which is understood to contain music in some preexisting folder structure), it will organize all the music into a well-organized and systematic file structure.

for any songs that don't have metadata attached, we can put them into an "unorganized" folder.  perhaps we can write another function in the program that attempts to recognize/add metadata to songs that have insufficient metadata?

I also want documention for how to use the script, as well as thorough documentation for how to set up the script to run nightly via cron.

I also want a --dryrun mode that previews the changes that would be made but that doesn't actually make any changes yet.
